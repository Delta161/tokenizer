/**
 * Example Components
 * 
 * This directory contains example components that demonstrate how to use the shared composables.
 * These are not meant to be used in production, but rather serve as reference implementations
 * for how to refactor existing components to use the shared composables.
 * 
 * Examples:
 * - FormExample.vue: Shows how to use useForm, useFileUpload, useLoading, and useFormatter
 * - ListExample.vue: Shows how to use usePagination, useLoading, and useFormatter
 * - ApiExample.vue: Shows how to use useApi, useNotification, useConfirmation, useFormatter, and usePagination
