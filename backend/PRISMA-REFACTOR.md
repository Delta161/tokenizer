# PrismaClient Consolidation Project

## Overview
This project aimed to consolidate multiple PrismaClient instances across the application into shared instances within each module. This approach reduces connection overhead, ensures consistent connection pools, simplifies testing, and improves resource management.

## Problem
Previously, multiple services and middleware were creating their own PrismaClient instances, leading to:
- Excessive database connections
- Potential connection pool exhaustion
- Inconsistent query behavior
- Resource leaks
- Difficulty in testing

## Solution
We implemented a modular approach to PrismaClient usage:

1. Each module now has a shared Prisma client utility that imports and re-exports the centralized client
2. Services and middleware within each module use this shared client
3. Module initialization functions no longer need to create new PrismaClient instances

## Modules Refactored

### Accounts Module
See detailed documentation in [Accounts Module Refactor](./src/modules/accounts/PRISMA-REFACTOR.md)

- Created shared client in `utils/prisma.ts`
- Updated services and middleware to use the shared client
- Updated authentication strategies (Google and Azure) to use the shared client
- Removed redundant PrismaClient instantiations
- Updated module initialization functions

### Analytics Module
See detailed documentation in [Analytics Module Refactor](./src/modules/analytics/PRISMA-REFACTOR.md)

- Created shared client in `utils/prisma.ts`
- Updated services to use the shared client
- Removed redundant PrismaClient instantiations

## App.ts Updates
- Updated import path for `authRouter` to use the one from the accounts module

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Connection Overhead**: A single PrismaClient instance per module means fewer database connections
2. **Consistent Connection Pool**: All queries within a module will use the same connection pool
3. **Simplified Testing**: Easier to mock a single client instance for testing
4. **Better Resource Management**: Prevents potential resource leaks from multiple client instances
5. **Improved Performance**: Fewer connections means less overhead and better database performance

## Future Work

1. Consider consolidating PrismaClient instances in other modules (client, investor, projects, etc.)
2. Implement a global PrismaClient middleware for logging and error handling
3. Add connection pool monitoring and metrics
