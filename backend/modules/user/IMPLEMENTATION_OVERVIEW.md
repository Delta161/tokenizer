# User Module Implementation Overview

## 🎯 Module Purpose

The User Module is a production-ready, fully functional component for managing user profiles in a tokenized real estate investment platform. It provides comprehensive user management capabilities after OAuth 2.0 authentication, including profile management, role-based access control, and admin functionality.

## 🚀 Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Core Functionality
- **User Profile Management**: Get and update user profiles
- **Role-Based Access Control**: INVESTOR, CLIENT, ADMIN roles
- **Admin User Management**: Admin-only endpoints for user oversight
- **Soft Delete**: Safe account deletion with data preservation
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation using Zod schemas
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with strict typing

### ✅ Security Features
- **Authentication Required**: All endpoints protected by JWT middleware
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control for sensitive operations
- **Data Sanitization**: Safe data transformation via mappers
- **Input Validation**: Prevents malicious input and data corruption
- **PII Protection**: Sensitive fields excluded from public responses

### ✅ Production Readiness
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Logging**: Structured logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Database Transactions**: Safe database operations
- **Performance**: Optimized queries and minimal data transfer
- **Scalability**: Clean architecture supporting future enhancements

## 🗄️ Database Schema Updates

### New Enums Added
```prisma
enum UserRole {
  INVESTOR
  CLIENT
  ADMIN
}

enum AuthProvider {
  GOOGLE
  AZURE
}
```

### User Model Extensions
```prisma
model User {
  id                 String        @id @default(uuid())
  email              String        @unique
  fullName           String
  authProvider       AuthProvider  # Changed from String to enum
  providerId         String        @unique
  avatarUrl          String?
  role               UserRole      @default(INVESTOR)  # NEW
  phone              String?                           # NEW
  timezone           String?                           # NEW
  preferredLanguage  String?                           # NEW
  deletedAt          DateTime?                         # NEW (soft delete)
  createdAt          DateTime      @default(now())
  updatedAt          DateTime      @updatedAt
  
  // Existing relations
  investor Investor?
  client   Client?
  wallets  Wallet[]
}
```

## 🛠️ API Endpoints

### User Profile Endpoints
| Method | Endpoint | Access | Description |
|--------|----------|--------|--------------|
| GET | `/users/me` | Authenticated | Get current user profile |
| PATCH | `/users/me` | Authenticated | Update current user profile |
| DELETE | `/users/me` | Authenticated | Soft delete current user |

### Admin Endpoints
| Method | Endpoint | Access | Description |
|--------|----------|--------|--------------|
| GET | `/users/:id` | Admin Only | Get any user profile by ID |
| GET | `/users` | Admin Only | Get all users (paginated) |

## 🔧 Integration Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install zod  # Already installed
```

### 2. Apply Database Migration
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev  # Already applied
npx prisma generate     # Already generated
```

### 3. Mount Routes in Your App
```typescript
import express from 'express';
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import { createUserRoutes } from './modules/user';

const app = express();
const prisma = new PrismaClient();

// Mount user routes
app.use('/api/users', createUserRoutes(prisma));
```

### 4. Ensure Auth Middleware is Available
The module depends on existing auth middleware:
- `requireAuth` from `../auth/requireAuth`
- `requireAdmin` from `../auth/requireRole`

## 📝 Usage Examples

### Get Current User Profile
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>" \
     http://localhost:3000/api/users/me
```

### Update User Profile
```bash
curl -X PATCH \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"fullName":"John Doe","phone":"+1234567890"}' \
     http://localhost:3000/api/users/me
```

### Admin: Get User by ID
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin_jwt_token>" \
     http://localhost:3000/api/users/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist
