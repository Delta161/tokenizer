# LastLoginAt Field Migration Guide

## Issue

The application code references a `lastLoginAt` field in the User model that didn't exist in the database schema. This caused errors when the application tried to update this field during user login.

## ✅ Fixed

This issue has been permanently fixed:

1. The `lastLoginAt` field has been added to the Prisma schema file (`schema.prisma`)
2. The migration has been successfully applied to the database (on 2025-07-22)
3. The auth service code has been updated to use the `lastLoginAt` field

## Applied Solution

The following steps were taken to fix this issue:

1. **Schema Update**: Added the `lastLoginAt` field to the Prisma schema file (`schema.prisma`)

2. **Database Migration**: Applied the migration using Prisma Migrate
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name add_last_login_field
   ```
   This created a migration file in `prisma/migrations/20250722100847_add_last_login_field/`

3. **Data Migration**: Initialized existing user records with the `lastLoginAt` field
   ```bash
   node scripts/add-last-login-field.js
   ```

4. **Code Update**: Updated the auth service code to use the `lastLoginAt` field
   - Changed from using `updatedAt` to `lastLoginAt` in the update operation
   - Added `lastLoginAt: new Date()` in the user creation logic

## Verification

The fix has been verified with the following checks:

1. ✅ Database schema now includes the `lastLoginAt` field
2. ✅ Existing users have been updated with an initial `lastLoginAt` value
3. ✅ The field can be successfully updated in the database

A test script was created to verify the functionality: `scripts/test-last-login-field.js`
