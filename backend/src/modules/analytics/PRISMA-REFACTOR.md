# PrismaClient Consolidation in Analytics Module

## Problem
The analytics module was creating multiple PrismaClient instances across different services, leading to connection overhead and potential performance issues.

## Solution
We've implemented a centralized approach to PrismaClient usage within the analytics module by:

1. Creating a shared Prisma client utility in `utils/prisma.ts` that imports and re-exports the centralized client from `src/prisma/client.ts`
2. Updating all services to use this shared client
3. Removing redundant PrismaClient instantiations

## Changes Made

### New Files
- Created `src/modules/analytics/utils/prisma.ts` to provide a shared client
- Created `src/modules/analytics/utils/index.ts` to export the shared client

### Modified Files
- `analytics.audit.service.ts`: Now uses the shared client
- `analytics.flags.service.ts`: Now uses the shared client
- `analytics.visit.service.ts`: Now uses the shared client
- `analytics.visit.analytics.service.ts`: Now uses the shared client

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Connection Overhead**: A single PrismaClient instance means fewer database connections
2. **Consistent Connection Pool**: All queries from the analytics module will use the same connection pool
3. **Simplified Testing**: Easier to mock a single client instance for testing
4. **Better Resource Management**: Prevents potential resource leaks from multiple client instances

## Usage

To use the shared Prisma client in any analytics module file:

```typescript
import { prisma } from './utils/prisma';
```

Or if importing from another module:

```typescript
import { prisma } from '@modules/analytics/utils/prisma';
```
