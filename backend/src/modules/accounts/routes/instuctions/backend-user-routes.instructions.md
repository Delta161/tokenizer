#### Purpose

This file defines all API routes related to user profile management. It enables authenticated users to retrieve and update their own profile data. The routes are intended to work with OAuth-based identity, relying on middleware to enforce access control.

---

#### Responsibilities

This route module handles profile retrieval and updates only for the currently authenticated user. It ensures users can view and manage their profile data securely, consistently, and in a frontend-friendly format. It also provides fallback logic to generate demo user data when needed during development.

---

#### Access Control

Every route in this module is protected using authentication middleware. Requests must be authenticated before reaching the route logic. The middleware is responsible for verifying access tokens and ensuring that only valid, logged-in users are granted access. This is aligned with OAuth 2.0 principles.

---

#### Development Considerations

For development and testing purposes, the system includes fallback logic that creates a demo user automatically if no users are found in the database. This is helpful for developers working on the frontend or testing routes in isolation without having to go through the full authentication and onboarding flow.

This fallback logic should be restricted to development environments only and should be removed or disabled in production deployments to avoid polluting the production database with test data.

---

#### Data Handling

When returning user data to the frontend, the routes transform and standardize the shape of the response. This includes structuring user profile fields, formatting timestamps, and mapping internal database fields to API-friendly naming conventions. This transformation ensures the frontend receives clean, predictable data.

Profile updates allow changes to certain fields such as name, phone, avatar, timezone, and preferred language. Updates are processed carefully to avoid overwriting important fields unintentionally. Full name handling combines the given and family name into a consistent format for storage.

---

#### Structure and Maintainability

While this file currently contains all route logic inline, best practices suggest separating route declarations from business logic. In future iterations, consider moving the request handlers into a dedicated controller file. This makes the codebase more modular and easier to maintain as complexity grows.

Similarly, data validation should be abstracted into validator modules to ensure that all incoming requests are sanitized and verified before interacting with the database.

---

#### Logging and Debugging

The module includes detailed logging for request handling, including indicators for route access, fallback creation logic, and error traces. These logs are valuable during development and debugging but should be managed carefully in production. Consider integrating a proper logging framework to handle log levels, context, and persistence.

---

#### Improvements to Consider

To align fully with modern backend architecture and best practices:

* Replace direct database queries for user retrieval with identity-bound queries using the authenticated user's ID.
* Introduce strong runtime validation for all update operations to prevent malformed or unauthorized input.
* Centralize error handling to avoid repeating try-catch logic in each route.
* Refactor duplicated logic between related endpoints to reduce maintenance overhead.
* Enforce environment-based feature toggles to control fallback behaviors like demo user generation.
